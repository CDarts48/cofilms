They have also been called the “glue of life” on Earth; they literally hold ecosystems together. But, there is evidence that the pace of decline among insects in parts of the world today is fast approaching the levels of previous catastrophes.\n\nWhat does this mean for the rest of life on Earth, including humans? What is causing this extinction crisis? What can be done to reverse the trend? Our new release The Little Things That Run the World introduces viewers to a diverse group of scientists, nature lovers, gardeners, farmers, and general bug enthusiasts in exploring the importance of flying insects amid rapid declines in their numbers. The film documents the mysteries of the declines alongside creative and heroic human efforts to change the course of evolutionary history. (Doug Hawes-Davis, 2025, USA, 1:45, NR)"

From the genocide of Indigenous peoples of the western hemisphere to the horrors of the Holocaust to the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda we realize that numbers make us numb. The more who die, the less we care. But, in 2019 another journey from darkness to light called “Ride for the Living” offered a way forward. Originating at the universal symbol of absolute evil (Auschwitz-Birkenau) 250 cyclists from 12 different countries came together to re-trace the WWII liberation path of a single 10-year Holocaust survivor across the Polish countryside to reach a destination symbolizing our common humanity: Krakow, Poland. Alternating between the intimate story of this one Holocaust survivor and the startling similarities among individuals in all genocides, these parallel journeys bring to life how we can grow our empathy to encompass millions. And how the American educational system has long overlooked—and in 2025 now threatens to whitewash–these stories and the insights we need to prevent future genocides. Inciting the urgent conversation: When will we stop building monuments for the Dead and get busy re-humanizing the Living? When will we finally say NEVER AGAIN and truly mean it?

We follow Matty Hannon on an incredible solo adventure, to surf the west coast of the Americas by motorbike, from the top of Alaska to the tip of Patagonia. But deep in the wilderness – alone with the wolves and the bears – the journeyer’s plans unexpectedly fall to pieces. After losing everything, and on the cusp of quitting he meets the girl of his dreams, a permaculture farmer named Heather Hillier who throws caution to the wind and sells her urban-farm to buy a bike of her own. Together riding south, the duo meet with Zapatista rebels, Amazonian shamans and Mapuche leaders whose salient words crack the adventurers’ cultural veneer, leaving them with existential questions.\n\nThe 50,000km surfing odyssey becomes beautifully complicated by their decision to downshift from motorcycles to horseback, presenting a relational approach to the breathtaking landscapes and a host of challenges that ultimately become extremely rewarding. Hannon and Hillier succeed in beautifully capturing deeply human moments during the world-first expedition, and the noticeable lack of camera-crew becomes The Road to Patagonia’s strength. The theme of deep ecology underpins the entire film, visually communicated through exquisite cinematography and emotional verité sequences. Shot over 16 years, the result is an adventurous exposé on the more-than-human world, offering a physical and spiritual odyssey to better understand our place in Nature.\n\nWinner – Best Film and Best Documentary – Byron Bay International Film Festival\n\nWinner – Audience Choice Award – Florida Surf Film Festival\n\nWinner – Audience Choice Award – Melbourne Documentary Film Festival\n\nWinner – Jury Award – Honolulu Surf Film Festival\n\nYear: 2024\n\nFilmmaker: Matty Hannon\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nPRODUCTION\n\n10 years\n\nWORLD PREMIERE\n\nByron Bay International F.F.\n\nPresented by the Boulder Environmental Nature Outdoors Film Festival AND DAIRY ARTS CENTER."

This documentary film is based on an international best-selling book. 999 Slovak girls ordered to register for government service are secretly deported on the first Jewish transport to Auschwitz. This chronicles the untold story of these mostly teenage girls betrayed by their government. Told that by volunteering for “work” they would fulfill their patriotic duty, these innocent young women willingly bid their families farewell. Under the cloak of deceit, they were transported on a one-way ticket to Auschwitz. The few who survived endured more than three years in the death camp. Meet the last living survivors of the First Jewish Transport and learn their story. (Beatriz M.Calleja & Heather Dune Macadam, 2025, 1:30, USA, NR) We will be joined by the director and author Heather Dune Macadam at a reception before the screening and for a talk-back after the screening.

Lockhart is a featured episode from the documentary series Art Titans: Masters of the New Era, a visionary project directed by acclaimed art world figures Alan Grimandi and Viviana Puello. The series chronicles the journeys of ten master artists whose practices are shaping the contemporary art landscape, offering intimate portraits that explore creative process, cultural impact, and the evolving role of artists in society. Kicking off Black History Month at the Dairy Arts Center, this special event also serves as a precursor to the upcoming exhibition Black Futures in Art (opening February 20), in which Dr. Thomas E. Lockhart III will be one of the exhibiting artists. The screening centers on Dr. Thomas E. Lockhart III, a celebrated realist painter whose work captures the essence of his subjects with precision, grace, and emotional depth. Moving beyond representation, Lockhart’s practice engages in powerful social commentary, exploring themes of history, identity, and collective consciousness. His work invites viewers to question, confront, and reconsider both personal and societal narratives. Following the screening, guests are invited to stay for an artist talk and Q&A with Dr. Thomas E. Lockhart III, offering deeper insight into his creative practice, influences, and artistic vision."

        "description": "Science on Screen® You Can’t Miss What You Forget Digital Memory and the Trouble with Letting Go What happens when we try to move on, but our data won’t let us? Following Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Dr. Anthony T. Pinter explores how our online “data shadows” preserve relationships, identities, and memories long after they’ve ended. As our lives change, the data that represents us often doesn’t, leaving behind digital versions of ourselves that no longer fit who we are now. The potential for incongruence between us and our online “data shadows” can be problematic during life transitions, or moments where our identities change significantly (e.g., coming out, dying, becoming a parent, amongst others). We may move on, but our data shadows follow; resurfacing data to make recommendations and encouraging us to reminisce. Much like sorting through the physical objects of sentimental value, our data must also be considered in the aftermath of life transitions; some want to delete everything, others prefer to keep and revisit it. Drawing from research on romantic breakups and digital identity, this talk looks at how people decide what to do with the data left behind after a relationship ends. From the framework of two curatorial philosophies – the archivist and revisionist – Dr. Pinter will discuss how people make decisions about what to do with their data, how they enact those decisions, and how to contend with the algorithmic curator. Blending themes of memory, loss, and control, this Science on Screen conversation asks a deceptively simple question: in a world where forgetting isn’t entirely up to us, what does it really mean to let go?

Sixteen to seventy-something, each carries her own idea of what it means to be a daughter: caregiver, rebel, keeper of the stories, breaker of the cycle. Over the course of three charged days and nights, the daughters navigate relationship, grief, and the business of the old house that contains them, alive in its own way with memory and an impressive population of mice. What unfolds is a darkly humorous, emotionally resonant exploration of identity, inheritance and the universal work of becoming who we are, despite (and because of) where we come from. The play culminates in DIY ceremony and catharsis – as tender, fierce and complicated as daughtering itself."
